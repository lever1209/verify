# verify

this is a dead project of mine that uses most of the original nopalmo code and improves on most of it

it was written at a time where i did not know how to use databases, nor did i really care

there are most likely very terribly written functions and similar, this is here for archival purposes

it was also dropped halfway through and ive got no idea if it even runs

##### if you want something functional and nice to look at check out [nopalmo](https://github.com/lever1209/nopalmo)
